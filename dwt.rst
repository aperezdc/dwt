SYNOPSIS
========

``dwt -e``


DESCRIPTION
===========

The ``dwt`` program is a terminal emulator for the the X Window System. It
provides DEC VT102/VT220 emulation.


USAGE
=====

Command line options:

-e COMMAND, --command=COMMAND
              Run the given *COMMAND* in the terminal window, instead of the
              user shell. If the command has multple arguments, make sure to
              quote it properly: the whole command line has to be passed as
              a single command line option.

-w PATH, --workdir=PATH
              Change the active directory to the given *PATH* before running
              the shell (or any other command) inside the terminal window.

-t TITLE, --title=TITLE
              Defines the initial *TITLE* of the terminal window (which, by
              default, is "dwt"). Even when a title is specified,
              applications may override it using `xterm(1)`-compatible
              escape sequences.

-f FONT, --font=FONT
              Sets the font used by the terminal emulator. The font name is
              interpreted using FontConfig. The default is "terminus 11".

-h, --help    Show a summary of available options.


EXAMPLES
========

Run Vim in a new terminal window, to edit a file with spaces in its file
name::

  dwt --command='vim "~/foo bar.txt"

Launch a new terminal window, specifying an alternative title for it::

  dwt --title='Dev Ops'


ENVIRONMENT
===========

If the ``SHELL`` environment variable is defined, it is assumed that it
contains the path to the shell that will be run as default command in the
terminal window. If not defined, `getpwuid(3)` will be used to determine the
user shell.
